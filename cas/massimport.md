# Automated Data Import

CAs who have a **large** number of intermediate certificates to add to the [CCADB](http://ccadb.org/cas/intermediates) may request that their data be mass imported from a spreadsheet or CSV file, by sending email to their root store operator. Doing the mass import process involves a significant amount of manual work, so if you have less than 20 intermediate certificates please enter them by hand.

## Data Import Process

Intermediate certificate data may be automatically imported from a CSV file for one CA at a time. The data will first be imported into a test environment and checked, before it will be imported into production.

Within the CCADB we will load the CA's data from CSV file(s) into a staging object, which we've called "Migrate Certs". After the data is loaded into the staging object, we can view a staging record for each intermediate cert to be imported, and also view reports on that data. After checking the staging records, we will run a batch program that will read all records from the Migrate Certs object and process them in two steps. Step one prepares a list of qualifying records for processing/reprocessing. Qualifying records are those that have not yet been migrated, and there is already a CCADB record for the Issuing certificate (parent). Step two parses the PEM data of each item from the list and adds the corresponding intermediate certificate record. The batch program may be run multiple times to add child certs or after making data corrections.

When the batch program is no longer updating records, a report of the imported certs will be generated which indicates if the cert was imported or not, and the error if the cert was not imported. The report contains: Certificate Name, Parent Certificate Name, Processing Message/Error, X.509 Certificate (PEM).

For each of the errors, the CA will be responsible for entering the [intermediate certificate data](http://ccadb.org/cas/intermediates) themselves
