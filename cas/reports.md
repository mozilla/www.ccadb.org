# Viewing Reports #

After logging in to the CCADB, click on the "Reports" tab, then click on the
"CA Community Reports" link along the left column, then click on one of the
reports in the list. Whenever you click on the "Reports" tab it will list the
reports that you have recently viewed. You will need to click on the "CA
Community Reports" link to see all of the reports that are available to you.

The available reports are:

* **My Included Root Certs** -- The currently-included root certificates for
  your CA.
* **All Public Intermediate Certs** -- All public (non-revoked) intermediate
  certificates that have been entered into the CCADB.
* **All Revoked Intermediate Certs** -- All revoked intermediate certificates
  that have been entered into the CCADB.
* **My Public Intermediate Certs** -- The public (non-revoked) intermediate
  certificates that have been entered into the CCADB for your CA.
* **My Revoked Intermediate Certs** --  The revoked intermediate certificates
  that have been entered into the CCADB for your CA.
* **My Blank Intermediate Certs** -- The intermediate cert records that you
  have entered that have the default value, "&lt;Fill in CA Owner/Cert
  name&gt;", for the certificate name. This means that you need to enter the
  certificate's PEM data to update the record.
