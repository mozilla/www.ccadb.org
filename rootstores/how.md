# Root Store Membership #

If you are a browser manufacturer or developer of software that includes
a trusted root certificate store that you actively manage, you may wish to
consider joining the CCADB as a Root Store Operator.

## Membership Requirements ##

Applicants for membership must:

* Be a browser manufacturer or developer of software that includes trusted
  root certificates, such software product being intended for use by the
  general public.
* Agree to [Mozilla’s Common CA Database Agreement][CCADB-Agreement].
* Comply with [Mozilla's terms](usage) governing usage of the CCADB.

In addition, participation in the CCADB is at Mozilla’s
discretion. Mozilla reserves the right not to include a particular Root Store
Operator in the CCADB, and not to issue a license to the Common
CA Database for any or no reason, including without limitation cases where we
believe that including or issuing a license to a Root Store Operator would
interfere with the operation or security of the CCADB, or would
breach our agreements with the underlying CRM.

## Membership Application ##

To begin the process, submit your application by sending email to
certificates@mozilla.org. Here are the points you should address in your
application:

* Written confirmation that you produce a software product that includes
  trusted root certificates, and is intended for use by the general public.
* The organization name, as you wish it to appear in the CCADB
  and in official documents.
* The URL of your main Web site.
* Names and email addresses of your employees who will participate in the
  CCADB (Full names and nicknames with surnames will be helpful
  in future communications).
* Emergency contact information for security issues related to certificate
  trust lists (Email addresses, at least one telephone number, and full names
  and nicknames with surnames will be helpful in future communications).
* The following information for the person who has the authority to sign
  [Mozilla's Common CA Database Agreement][CCADB-Agreement] on behalf of your
  organization:
    * Signatory information (name, email address, title);
    * Legal entity name and address;
    * Names and email addresses of anyone who needs to be CC'd on the
      agreement.

If there are any questions about your application, we will get back to you.
Otherwise, once we have received this information, Mozilla will make a
determination on whether to include your organization as a Root Store Operator
and communicate its determination to you, along with any information about your
membership and participation.
