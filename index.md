The Common CA Database (CCADB) is a repository of information about
Certificate Authorities (CAs), and their root and intermediate certificates
that are used in the WebPKI - the publicly-trusted system which underpins
secure connections on the Web. The CCADB is used by a number of different
root store operators to manage their root stores, but it is run by
[Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/mission/).
